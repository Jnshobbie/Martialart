 My first coding project ! at 16. Used to love coding a lot 
  so i decided to build games at the time, and didn't took coding seriously
    now i'm 20, i decided to take it more seriously and make a living out of it
      but before i dive deep into it ! a few days ago while i was on my computer
       i came acrossed my old projects and decided to upload them on github.
         so let's get it ! this is the first one, im really excited to see where this coding journey will get me ! 
          WITH GOD anything is possible !
